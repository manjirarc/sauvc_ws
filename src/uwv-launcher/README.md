## Overview
This repository aims at easily generating worlds to be used in conjunction with [uwv-simulator](https://github.com/auvsocietyiiitdm/uwv-simulator). This is a GUI based application where different objects found at SAUVC can be placed in the pool in different configurations to finally generate a ROS/Gazebo launch file.

## Installation

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
